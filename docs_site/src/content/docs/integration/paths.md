title: Integration Paths
description: Integrate Warden into your application using the HTTP API, Go client, or Go library.
---

Warden is designed to be integrated into your own applications. Start with the [Architecture](../architecture/) page to understand how the layers fit together, then choose an integration path below.

## Three binaries

Warden ships as three binaries that provide different integration levels:

| Binary           | What it is                                    | Code location         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `warden`         | Headless engine + API server (for developers) | `cmd/warden/`         |
| `warden-desktop` | Engine + web UI + browser launch (for users)  | `cmd/warden-desktop/` |
| `warden-tui`     | Engine + TUI (for terminal users)             | `cmd/warden-tui/`     |

All three binaries use the same engine under the hood. The `cmd/` entry points are thin — they call `warden.New()`, set up their UI layer, and run.

## Key packages

All packages are importable via `go get github.com/thesimonho/warden`:

| Package         | Purpose                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `warden` (root) | High-level `App` — wires everything together       |
| `access`        | Credential passthrough model (items, credentials, resolution) |
| `api`           | API contract types (request/response/result)       |
| `client`        | Typed HTTP client for the Warden API               |
| `service`       | Business logic layer                               |
| `engine`        | Container engine client + domain types             |
| `eventbus`      | Event system (broker, store, listener)             |
| `db`            | SQLite database store (projects, settings, events) |
| `runtime`       | Container runtime detection                        |
| `agent`         | Agent status provider interface                    |

See the [Go Packages](../../reference/go/) reference for full API documentation.

## Integration paths

If you're building in Go, you have two additional options: a **client package** that wraps the API for convenience, or importing the **library directly** to skip the binary entirely.

## HTTP API (any language)

Run the `warden` binary as a headless server and make HTTP requests to `/api/v1/*`. This works from any language and is the recommended integration path.

Ship the `warden` binary with your application and start it as a subprocess, or run it as a standalone service.

See the [HTTP API guide](../http-api/) for setup, examples, and the full error code reference. See the [API Reference](../../reference/api/) for endpoint documentation.

## Go client (convenience wrapper)

If you're building a Go application that talks to a running `warden` server, the [`client`](https://github.com/thesimonho/warden/tree/main/client) package provides a typed wrapper around the HTTP API. It's the same API — just easier to call from Go.

```go
import "github.com/thesimonho/warden/client"

c := client.New("http://localhost:8090")
projects, err := c.ListProjects(ctx)
```

See the [Go client guide](../go-client/) for details and error handling.

## Go library (direct import)

If you want to skip the binary entirely and embed Warden's engine in your Go process, import the library directly. No HTTP server, no subprocess — just call the API in-process.

```go
import "github.com/thesimonho/warden"

app, err := warden.New(warden.Options{})
defer app.Close()
projects, _ := app.Service.ListProjects(ctx)
```

See the [Go library guide](../go-library/) for the full API.

## When to use which

| Approach                     | When to use                                        | What you ship                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [HTTP API](../http-api/)     | Any language, simplest integration                 | `warden` binary + your app     |
| [Go client](../go-client/)   | Go app, want typed API calls without managing HTTP | `warden` binary + your Go app  |
| [Go library](../go-library/) | Go app, want single-process deployment, no binary  | Your Go app (imports `warden`) |

## Reference implementations

Both the web dashboard and TUI use the exact same public interfaces you would:

- **TypeScript/Web**: [`web/src/lib/api.ts`](https://github.com/thesimonho/warden/blob/main/web/src/lib/api.ts) — every endpoint call pattern, `ApiError` class with `code` field
- **TypeScript types**: [`web/src/lib/types.ts`](https://github.com/thesimonho/warden/blob/main/web/src/lib/types.ts) — request/response shapes
- **SSE handling**: [`web/src/hooks/use-event-source.ts`](https://github.com/thesimonho/warden/blob/main/web/src/hooks/use-event-source.ts) — reconnection strategy
- **Terminal WebSocket**: [`web/src/hooks/use-terminal.ts`](https://github.com/thesimonho/warden/blob/main/web/src/hooks/use-terminal.ts) — binary I/O, resize
- **Go HTTP client**: [`client/`](https://github.com/thesimonho/warden/tree/main/client) — typed Go wrapper around the HTTP API
